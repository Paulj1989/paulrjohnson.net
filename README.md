# Website & Blog

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/c550a53e-272d-41e0-8cb0-923421910df2/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/paulj1989/deploys)

This repository contains everything for my [personal website](https://paulrjohnson.net), including all [blog posts](https://paulrjohnson.net/blog). The site is built using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) and [deployed](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/netlify.html) via [Netlify](https://netlify.com).
## Acknowledgements

While plenty of work went into making the site my own, I used Silvia Canel√≥n's [website](https://silviacanelon.com/) [repository](https://github.com/spcanelon/silvia) as a starting point, and their excellent blog post about [porting Hugo websites to Quarto](https://silviacanelon.com/blog/2023-09-29-hello-quarto/) as guidance. 

I also learned a great deal from Jadey Ryan's [guide to publishing Quarto websites with GitHub & Netlify](https://jadeyryan.com/blog/2023-11-19_publish-quarto-website/) and Danielle Navarro's blog post about [porting Distill blogs to Quarto](https://blog.djnavarro.net/posts/2022-04-20_porting-to-quarto/), and both helped me customise the site and get everything setup as it is now.

The CV is adapted from the template put together by [Cynthia Huang](https://www.cynthiahqy.com/posts/cv-html-pdf/).
