Last year I wrote a [blog post](/blog/setting-up-netlify-redirects-with-quarto) about my process for generating Netlify redirects. It was a similar process to that many others use, adapted slightly to work for my slightly different setup. It involved housing a couple chunks of code in the homepage (`index.qmd` in the root directory) that would generate redirects every time the homepage is rendered.

This worked fine. It got the job done. But it bugged me that I had to make sure to remember to re-render the homepage every time I needed to update the redirects file. This relied too heavily on my remembering to do something. So, I've finally had a crack at fixing this and setting something up that will run without my intervention.

I've setup a Lua script that is called before the whole project is rendered. I figured a short post running through what I've done and how it works might be useful to others trying to figure this out, and it should be relatively easy to adjust to your own needs.

## The Old Setup: Dependencies

I won't spend too long going over the old approach (you can find it in the [blog post](/blog/setting-up-netlify-redirects-with-quarto) I wrote last year). It worked, and I never actually forgot to re-render the homepage in order to update the redirects. But I didn't love having to go through that extra step, and I certainly didn't trust myself to have to remember this bit.

Creating dependencies is an unecessary mess when all I want to do is generate some redirects from a relatively simple website structure.

## The Solution: Lua, Pre-Render Hooks, Automation

Instead, I wrote a [Lua](https://www.lua.org) script[^AI] that is set to run before any Quarto document renders (using Quarto's [pre/post rendering functionality](https://quarto.org/docs/projects/scripts.html#pre-and-post-render)), which generates all my redirects in a file that is stored at root for Netlify to pick up and use in deployment.

It's effectively the same process as I followed before, but by shifting it into a separate script that runs when Netlify renders the site (using the Quarto Netlify plugin), I no longer have to worry about making sure to run this before I push a new post.

I chose Lua because it is already packaged up in Quarto's installation, as Pandoc uses Lua as its filter language, and Netlify recognises it when deploying the site. That means no extra work is required with a Lua script. Lua is relatively simple, and if you have experience with R and/or Python, it shouldn't take long to pick it up[^Resources].

There are three types of redirects handled by this script:

- **Manual Redirects** - These are hand-written rules stored in a `_manualredirects` file, giving you complete control over specific URL mappings.
- **Blog Post Redirects** - Automatically generated rules that redirect from simple URLs (`/blog/my-post-title`) to the full dated URLs (`/blog/2025-05-26-my-post-title`).
- **Category Redirects** - Dynamic redirects that map tag-style URLs (`/tags/lua`) to filtered blog views (`/blog/#category=lua`).

[^AI]:

Full disclosure, I had help from Claude AI, because I've never used Lua before. But I think it is relatively simple and should be adaptable without needing help yourself.

If you need to figure out Lua, I'd recommend this [Learn Lua in 15 Minutes](https://learnxinyminutes.com/lua/) resource, as well as this [Lua Cheatsheet](https://quarto.org/docs/extensions/luarefv51.pdf).

### Key Components

#### Environment Detection

```lua
local project_root = system.get_working_directory()
local netlify_build_dir = os.getenv("NETLIFY") and os.getenv("NETLIFY_BUILD_BASE")
```

The script first determines where it's running - locally during development or on Netlify during deployment. This flexibility ensures it works in both environments.

#### File System Operations

Lua provides basic file I/O operations, which the script uses:

- **Directory checking**: Verifying that blog directories exist
- **File reading**: Processing blog post metadata and manual redirect files
- **File writing**: Creating the final `_redirects` file

#### Pattern Matching

One of Lua's strengths is its pattern matching system. The script uses this to find my blog posts based on the pattern of ISO dates at the start of a blog post folder.

```lua
-- Extract date-prefixed blog posts
if post_name and post_name:match("^%d%d%d%d%-%d%d%-%d%d%-") then
    local title_slug = post_name:gsub("^%d%d%d%d%-%d%d%-%d%d%-", "")
```

This finds blog posts with names like `2025-05-26-my-post-title` and extracts just the title part.

#### Category Processing

The script reads each blog post's Quarto metadata to extract categories:

```lua
local cat_match = line:match("^categories:%s*%[(.+)%]")
```

This looks for lines like `categories: [Netlify, Quarto, Web Development, Lua]` in the blog post's YAML header.

## Wrapping Up

So that's a job well done. Now, every time I publish a new blog post or add categories, the redirects are automatically updated without any manual intervention.
