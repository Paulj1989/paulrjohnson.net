    If we don't call them resolutions then they can't be doomed to failure.

    Spending some time reflecting on my career as a data scientist and the role 
    this blog played in my development in 2024, before considering where I want 
    to go with the site in 2025 and how I want to continue improving as a data
    scientist.

I'm not one for New Year's Resolutions. I'm not one of those that hates them, either. It's good to set goals for yourself, and using a new year as a starting point to help motivate you seems as good an approach as any! We fail at our goals because we're bad at setting them and changing habits is hard. Still, I don't tend to set myself resolutions, mostly because I can't be bothered.

I do want to use the new year as an opportunity to think about what I want to achieve in 2025, though. They're not resolutions.
