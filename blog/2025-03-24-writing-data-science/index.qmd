I have often received compliments for my writing over the years, both when writing about data science and when writing about some other nonsense. Scientific communication is probably one of my best strengths as a data scientist, though I am probably a little better at the written than the verbal. Perhaps the reason I receive compliments for my writing is because people don't have anything nice to say about the rest of my work? The analysis was trash but you explained the hell out of that trash! Well, if that's the case, I hope that I am well equipped to give some advice about how to approach writing about your good data science.

Most data scientists were the kids that excelled at math throughout school. Some of them would have viewed writing with the fear that the rest of the world views their beloved numbers. I'm not like most data scientists, though. I'm more stupid[^Stupid]. I was never that good at math growing up. I was a writer. I was eventually dragged, kicking and screaming, into the world of numbers (or, even worse, letters as numbers), but I took to the arts more naturally. While this has given me a deep sense of inferiority, it has also given me a bit of a niche. I know what it feels like to be scared of math, and my instincts are to explain with words (instead of little fancy symbols that apparently mean numbers that we don't know). I'm also more comfortable communicating with the normies than your average nerd, and I have been writing my silly little stories since a very young age.

It seems as though this niche doesn't just point to my being worse at my job than everyone else. I have been told, often, that I'm a pretty good writer, particularly when it comes to writing about data science. So in an effort to clue the nerds in on the one thing I'm better at than them, I thought I'd write a blog post that talks about writing about data science. I am hoping to offer some advice on how to communicate about data science generally, because much of this advice applies to other forms of communication too, but the focus will be on writing because this is the bit I'm best at. Sometimes I do the words much better when I draw them not say them.

<!-- Much of this advice will apply to writing in other technical or academic fields, but where data science may differ is in its potential to reach a more general audience. Data scientists cannot assume that readers possess similar technical skills or conceptual understanding, limiting the shortcuts to communicating findings. -->

[^Stupid]:

    I'm not suggesting that being good at writing or excelling at creative efforts
    makes you stupid. I'm just making a dumb joke at my own expense.

## A Brief Note on What This Post Is Not

The focus of this post is specifically on writing in the context of data science, not writing generally. I am not arrogant enough to think I have anything to offer to a general audience seeking to become better writers. At the very least, you'd probably be better off going to actual professional writers if that's what you're after, and there are tons of resources written by these people, all of which can teach you a great deal more than I can.

For advice on how to approach your writing, and general advice on what being a good writer looks like, I'd recommend William Zinsser's [-@zinsser2001] _On Writing Well_ and Stephen King's [-@king2020] _On Writing_. With regards to the technical aspects of writing well, however, I'd highly recommend William Strunk & E.B. White's [-@strunk1999] _Elements of Style_ and George Gopen & Judith Swan's [-@gopen1990] _The Science of Scientific Writing_. They all know a lot more than I do about writing, and all of these resources come highly recommended. I will also reference several other resources that I've found particularly useful throughout this post, and where possible I will include links to those resources in the bibliography.

While some of my suggestions do veer into "advice about writing", I have done my best to limit myself to instances where I believe more general advice about writing do not apply to the data science context. I am not equipped to make claims about what is right or wrong generally, nor arrogant enough to think my views hold as much weight as the likes of Stephen King (though there is one instance where I do seem to take a different position to many others). But I do think there are meaningful distinctions worth making about writing about data science.

I also won't give any tips on how to come up with ideas, how to approach theory generation, or anything adjacent. You can't write if you don't have anything to write about, but I also don't have anything of value to offer here. My brain is a tombolo filled with garbage. All my ideas come from rustling around in the shuffled trash pile and living with the consequences of whatever I pull out. If I ever come up with a good answer to the question of how to come up with good ideas consistently, I will be sure to share it. Or monetise it.

Finally, this post is neither definitive nor authoritative; it may even be complete nonsense[^Disclaimer]. I want to be clear that the authority that allows me to write this post was granted to me by myself, the owner of this silly little website, and was only motivated by the fact that I am occasionally complemented for my communication skills in this domain. If you think anything I've said here is wrong or stupid, you might be right[^Abuse]. If you think something doesn't apply to you in a particular context, or you think I've missed something, you might be right. This is only intended to share some of what has helped me become a better writer. It's important to remember I'm just some dumb idiot that continues, despite everyone's best efforts, to log on and post. What do I know? I'm not ChatGPT!

[^Disclaimer]:

    To be fair, I'd like to add this disclaimer to all of my posts, but this time
    it is even more the case.

[^Abuse]:

    But please don't send me angry letters written using a stick from your back
    garden and your own feaces.

## Why You Write

If you're not convinced that spending more time thinking about your writing and working to improve your craft is a worthwhile pursuit for a data scientist, I'd highly recommend spending some time to consider why you are writing, both you specifically and data scientists in general. Writing is obviously, first and foremost, a vehicle for communicating findings, but is that all it is?

One of the most fundamental uses for writing is thinking. Paul Graham's [-@graham2024], quoting Leslie Lamport, says "if you're thinking without writing, you only think you're thinking.‚Äù This is a sentiment shared by [Larry McEnerney]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFwVf5a3pZM&t=551s) in his talk on academic writing at University of Chicago (which I discovered when [Mark Thompson](https://get-goalside-newsletter-archive.beehiiv.com/p/bloggings-cool-again) shared it in a post a while ago). Writing is a great way to organise your thoughts, to identify weaknesses in your argument, and to turn a disparate mess of half-baked mush stored in your head into something coherent. Data scientists will often be dealing with complex ideas that compete and connect in messy ways, and trying to juggle these ideas in your head is a recipe for disaster. Putting pen to paper, or fingertips to keyboard, is an opportunity to lay out everything you're working with like a child turfing out a toy box.

Beyond writing as thinking, I think a very closely connected idea (that is perhaps a little less commonly expressed), is the idea of writing as learning. A big part of why I maintain this blog is that it is a great opportunity for me to keep pushing the boundaries of my skillset and knowledge base. I build on what I know when I have to write it down for others. Partly because I don't want to make a fool of myself, but also because I want to do a good job, and when I start writing ideas out, it quickly becomes clear where I need to do further research and fill some gaps. Something like a blog is a perfect motivation for continual learning.

Finally, because I am concerned that this post sounds like some sort of optimisation maxing nonsense, I think it's important to stress the biggest reason of all for writing -- it's fun! I think there's value to honing your writing whether you like it or not, but if you really don't find any joy in writing about any subject at all, I don't know how easy it is to improve, nor if it's a worthwhile endeavour. I think writing can be pretty fulfilling when the subject matter is of interest, even if the process itself can be painful at times[^Process].

[^Process]:

    I also recognise I am able to enjoy it more as someone for whom writing is a small
    part of my job and a silly little hobby.

## Writing the Right Way

The focus here is on the approach rather than the technicalities of writing about data science. The technical elements of good writing remain consistent across context and domain, so I will defer to writers with much greater expertise in this regard. Instead, my advice will cover how data scientists should approach writing at a macro and a micro level.

### Writing is Not an Afterthought

It is not uncommon to find excellent data scientists that are not great writers. I think there are many reasons for this, but no doubt a big part of it is that many data scientists have spent their lives excelling at mathematics. They have focused their energy on numbers, because they are good at it and they enjoy it, and they have not necessarily had the opportunity to develop their verbal or written communication skills. I'm sure the same applies to most of us, in certain areas. In my case, it was math that fell to the wayside, until I was rudely reminded of this reality when I ended up needing to know my times tables during my PhD.

Still, I think it's only natural that certain skills are prioritised when they are those that you are excelling, and when those skills become your career, that positive feedback loop becomes very engrained. For someone who has always communicated through math and has always been very good at doing that, writing becomes an afterthought.

For many data scientists, I think the communication of findings is a lower priority than the rest of the workflow, particularly the analysis. Regardless of the medium for communicating the findigns, or the context of the project (whether personal or professional), it tends to be an element of the work that is given little thought until all the fun parts are done and there's nothing left to do but get the project over the line. I totally understand this instinct and can't claim to be all that much better myself, but I really think this is a mistake.

Not only is it important to keep thinking about how the analysis you are doing can be presented when it comes to communicating your results, so as to tailor outputs and work efficiently, writing well requires giving it the same attention that you would a complex model. The writing needs to be considerd as a fundamental part of the process, not just because it forces you to take it seriously and do a better job with it, but because it literally **is** a fundamental part of the process. What good is any of the hard work you've done leading up to that point if no one can understand what you've found, or worse, they are misled by your efforts to communicate the results?

When writing about science, the writing itself is only one component of your communication efforts. It's the most vital tool at your disposal, and you should treat it as the centrepiece in your plan of attack. Still, it's important to remember that analytics gives you a few other tools that are not always available to other writers. You can express ideas through mathematical notation, where appropriate[^Notation], and causal diagrams are an excellent way of laying out your theory intuitively and visually. Perhaps the best tool of all is to visualise the data, though. If a picture is worth a thousand words, surely a plot is worth at least a couple hundred? I'm not going to spend any time talking about your use of these different tools for communication here (Rohan Alexander's [-@alexander2023] _Telling Stories With Data_ goes into detail about this stuff in the Communication section of the book). Still, I will say that you should view all of these methods as tools in your armoury, and you should pick and choose between them deliberately to simplify your work and, as a result, amplify your writing.

Putting the writing at the front and centre is vital for good data science, but it also nudges you in the right direction in terms of writing the right way. If you care about your writing like you care about your analysis, you'll invest a similar amount of time iterating over the results to maximise the performance. @zinsser2001 talks about the time he invests in his writing, pouring over every sentence, reading and rereading passages just to identify and replace the word that makes it feel clunky, and playing with draft after draft so that the end result can be the best version of his work. Any data scientist can recognise this process, except it applies to the model, not the writing.

Instead of treating the writing stage as the means to an end, a vehicle to carry the previous cargo found in the code blocks that break up the text, treat writing as central to everything you're doing. If you want to improve your writing, afford it the same weight you do to the other parts of the process and treat it as a part of the journey, and a part of the fun. A well written analysis is just as satisfying as the analysis itself. Approaching writing this way is certainly not sufficient, but it is necessary.

[^Notation]:

    Notation is defensible in plenty of cases, and if the audience is primed and ready
    to deal with your fancy little equations when they come across them, it can more
    succinct and more effective than using the written word. But don't assume everyone
    is fine with notation.

### Data Science for the Masses

William Zinsser [-@zinsser2001] lists "four articles of faith" in _On Writing Well_: clarity, simplicity, brevity, and humanity[^Humanity]. I think these are excellent guiding principles for writing that is accessible and engaging.

First and foremost, the goal should be to distil complex ideas as simply as possible. Data science is difficult. Why make it more difficult by overcomplicating how you communicate about it? The Pulitzer Prize winner Cormac McCarthy recommends "minimalism to achieve clarity" [@savage2019]. He advises writers to constantly ask themselves whether words and punctuation marks need to be there, removing anything superfluous. He also suggests that simple, short sentences are effective when communicating about science because they help the reader focus on the key message. Finally, perhaps his best advice relates to theme and structure, recommending a focus on two or three points you want the reader to take away from reading your work[^Research].

In a field like data science, honest intent is vital, too. Write to show the reader something cool, teach people about an interesting method, or play around with a fun new tool. There are lots of good reasons for writing about data science. But don't write to demonstrate your intelligence. Going in looking to prove how smart you are will encourage you to overcomplicate things. Complexity is a distraction. "Jargon is the enemy of clarity" [@plaxco2010]. Data science is complicated enough, so why make it harder for your readers by taking the scenic route?

There is nothing wrong with wanting to give a good impression. My natural state is the class clown, so I'm more concerned that readers laugh at my dumb jokes than think I'm a clever little boy. But I still don't want everyone to think I'm talking nonsense. I think it's important that these goals are secondary, though. Writing about a complex subject with clarity, simplicity, brevity, and humanity will achieve these secondary goals. Readers will be a lot more impressed if you can do this.

So much of this advice ultimately comes down to making your audience a central consideration. Write for yourself, but communicate with your readers. Write about subjects you are passionate about, methods you love, or study questions to which the answer interests you. But when you write, do so with close consideration to who will read your work, and adjust your approach to make it as accessible and engaging as possible. That doesn't mean that your work can't be complex. There is plenty of room for deep, complex analyses. But write in simple terms. Write in terms that allow any reader to at least read the words and understand the sentence they just read. If they do not have the necessary prerequisite knowledge to understand what it all means, that's not on you. But it shouldn't be your writing that stops someone from following along.

The reality is that data science is not always straightforward, and there are plenty of times when it won't be possible to write something in simple terms. However, I think the goal should always be to try and simplify what you're saying without losing its meaning. How far is that? It's hard to say, and the answer will always vary based on subject, context, and audience. Still, simplicity is generally a good goal for writing, especially when writing about data science.

[^Humanity]:

    This section focuses on the first three principles, but humanity is no less critical.
    Writing with humanity means putting human beings at the centre of your writing. Tell
    human stories, talk about what you love about a particular topic, and highlight your
    work's effects on real people. Speak to readers in terms that make them want to keep
    reading.

[^Research]:

    McCarthy's focus is on academic writing, but I think this approach can be applied to
    writing in many contexts. When dealing with a complex topic, as is so often the case
    in data science, it will help.

### Practice, Practice, Practice

I think the most important step you can take in improving your writing is to write. Until recently, I didn't give much thought to the technicalities of writing and how I might be better at it. Not because I didn't think it was important. Just because I figured it is something I do reasonably well and I hadn't found the time to improve it. However, I've spent many years writing for a variety of audiences, and this has helped me hone my skills without giving it much thought. That doesn't mean I do a perfect job (far from it). I think spending more time thinking about this stuff from a technical perspective has already helped me improve, and I'm sure there will always be more I could do, but practice has helped me find my voice and become comfortable as a writer.

In reality, however "good" I am at this, it is primarily a consequence of having spent plenty of time writing about silly little things on the Internet. I have been a writer and editor for the Borussia Dortmund fan site, [Fear the Wall](https://fearthewall.com) for many years, writing over 600 articles. Most of those articles are trivial coverage of matches or transfers, but it has given me an opportunity to practice my writing and find my voice[^FTW]. While I do occasionally write about football analytics, it's rare that I am writing something for Fear the Wall that has much overlap with data science, but practice is practice, and this experience has made it so much easier for me now. The writing side comes a little easier, so I have more time to focus on conveying the message and figuring out how to achieve my goals and reach the people I want to reach.

If possible, find a way to carve out time to write daily (or, if this doesn't work, at least once a week). Write about anything that interests you. It doesn't have to be public work. Perhaps you could write a diary? But sit down and write. Just like any craft, from data science to sport to cooking, getting better at writing requires doing it more. The more you do it, the easier it comes, and the easier it comes the more you can try stuff, and figure out what works for you and what doesn't.

[^FTW]:

    In many ways, I think the trivial stuff was more useful for honing my craft.
    When you're tasked with writing several hundred words about some absolutely
    abysmal game that you can't muster any thoughts about, you start to experiment,
    and in those moments of desperation I think you can really find a style that
    works for you!

#### Enjoy the Process

One of the central ideas behind regularly writing so that you can get more comfortable and improve your writing is that, once comfortable, you will start to develop a "voice". Your writing voice is your distinct style. It's how you approach communicating your ideas, your common vocabulary, and the devices and methods you lean on to tell your story. The idea of a writer's voice is not novel for professional writers. But I think it's perhaps a little undervalued when it comes to writing about data science, particularly in professional settings. There is still value in finding your voice and writing in a consistent style when trying to communicate findings at work, in academic research, and even (and especially) for your silly little blog posts. Consistency makes you writing flow better, the familiarity will make your readers' lives easier, and a voice that is unique to you is a more pleasing read and is much more engaging.

While consistency matters, that doesn't mean you should be tightly constrained by your writing voice. When I am writing in a professional capacity, I am not as informal as I am in my blog posts (or on Fear the Wall). I vary the tone of my voice and approach depending on the circumstances/context. But that's no different to a regular voice. Your voice can still be recognised even if you're being a little more formal in a professional setting!

I can't speak to the best way to develop a writing voice, or how to think about your voice in different contexts, but what I do want to mention is that your voice doesn't have to be super serious in order for your work to be taken seriously, or because data science is a serious subject that is your serious career. There's nothing wrong with having fun. If you have read enough of my posts that you are now unconvinced that being a silly goose does not hurt your legitimacy or authority, two data scientists/statisticians that I've been influenced by are [Danielle Navarro](https://djnavarro.net) and [Dan Simpson](https://dansblog.netlify.app). Reading them both, besides having taught me plenty, helped me see that I can have fun while still writing about this stuff!

Your voice will differ from my voice. My voice is stupid. I spend a lot of my posts making stupid jokes and being deeply unserious. You might not be that person, and that's okay (good, even). But I think finding your voice is, at least in part, about practicing your writing and taking time to explore and find what feels natural to you and what you enjoy. Find the approach that you find enjoyable or fulfilling, and in that you're likely to find a writing style that feels like "you".

Paul Graham [-@graham2015] suggests writing like you talk, and I think this is good advice. How do you communicate with people when you are comfortable? How would you explain some aspect of data science to a friend that likes you enough not to disown you for talking about data science at them? Perhaps this is how you should write. William Zinsser [-@zinsser2001] doesn't go quite as far as advocating for writing like you talk as Graham, but he does make the observation that you see so much writing that would never come out of that person's mouth (or no human being's mouth ever). Zinsser is making a wider point about writing styles when he says this, but I want to steal this to just point out that the closer you can get to writing like you talk, the closer you are to sounding like a real human being using normal words in a normal order, and the closer you are to your own writing voice. This doesn't just benefit your writing voice, it also makes your work much easier to follow. Cormac McCarthy argues that "spoken language and common sense" serve as the best guides when writing your first draft, because it is more important that the reader can understand you than that you write to the letter of the grammatical law [@savage2019].

A common piece of advice that you will regularly hear from others, that, regrettably, I have come to believe is true, is that reading others' writing helps a lot too. Reading good writers that are covering a variety of topics exposes you to different approaches to writing, different ways of conveying a message, and should arm you with a wider toolset when considering how to tell a story.

I'm not as good at reading as I am writing. I have ADHD, so the idea of sitting still through someone else's entire story, without interrupting to tell my own, borders on abuse. But I do try and read writing from a variety of sources and covering my pretty wide range of interests (again, I have ADHD). There's obviously plenty of benefit to reading, far beyond making you a better writer[^Optimisation], but exposing yourself to this stuff and taking a moment to think through how other writers approach their craft, can really benefit you.

Getting good at writing is often about practice, but it's also about challenging yourself to improve, taking the time and effort to think about your writing and where it does and does not work, and considering how you can grow as a writer. Reading is a great accompaniment to writing.

[^Optimisation]:

    For a start, treating reading as an optimisation task sounds deranged because
    it's supposed to be a fun little hobby. Do it because you enjoy doing it and
    you find reading fulfilling, but recognise the added benefits you can get from it.

## Final Thoughts

Writing is hard. But it can also be fulfilling, when you get it right. William Zinsser [-@zinsser2001] tells an anecdote in _On Writing Well_ where he visited a school to talk about writing alongside a doctor that had recently written a book and for whom writing was a keen hobby instead of their primary career. While Zinsser talks about writing like it's agonising pain that you just have to endure. The doctor paints a much breezier picture. I'm wary of seeming like the breezy hobbyist claiming that writing is a joyous experience that leaves you feeling fulfilled, knowing that many folks will read this and laugh at me[^LOL]. Still, I do think this point is worth reiterating, because I get the sense it doesn't get recognised when talking about writing about something like data science (or science generally).

If you want to find those nuggets of fulfillment and joy, you need to start writing. Often. To whatever extent I am a good writer, it is owed to having plenty of practice writing about a variety of subjects and getting the opportunity to develop my voice and figure out how to achieve what I want to achieve with words. That, and the lower standards expected of a data scientist trying to communicate with words instead of numbers. Whatever your abilities, approach writing honestly, with humility, and with openness. If your intentions are good but your writing is bad, at least that can be changed with more practice.

[^LOL]:

    Don't laugh at me on the Internet. That's illegal.
