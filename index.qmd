::: {#hero-heading}

I am a data scientist at NHS South, Central and West CSU. I am interested in applying my knowledge of causal inference, statistics, probabilistic thinking, and machine learning to problems of understanding human behaviour.

At heart, I want to understand how the world works, and I enjoy telling stories that help others do the same, leveraging data and my quantitative skill set in the process.
