I am interested in applying my knowledge of causal inference, statistics, probabilistic thinking, and machine learning to problems of understanding human behaviour.\n\nAt heart, I want to understand how the world works, and I enjoy telling stories that help others do the same, leveraging data and my quantitative skill set in the process.\n\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::",
