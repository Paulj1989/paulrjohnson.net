Data scientist based in London, UK. Currently working for the NHS South, Central and West CSU in their Population Health Management team, where I work on a wide range of data science problems, from providing technical expertise when designing evaluations of healthcare interventions, building and deploying demand forecasting models, and driving the organisation's development of data infrastructure and data science expertise to grow the organisation's data science capabilities.

Some examples of projects I've led in my time at SCW:

- Leveraging publicly available data to understand the impact that deprivation has on health inequalities in England
- Using event counts data to build and deploy forecasting models of utilisation of emergency and urgent care resources in the NHS

Prior to working in the health sector, I have also carried out research in an academic setting, as a political scientist, and applied my skill set to sports analytics. My academic research focused on party and party system change, particularly the development of new political parties in established systems. In sports analytics, I have built an expected value model for volleyball, using data from women's college volleyball, and I have used event data to cluster football players and build a model that identifies players that are most similar to any player in the dataset.

I am interested in combining my formal education in statistics and quantitative methods with my knowledge of machine learning and deep learning, and applying these techniques to problems of understanding human behaviour and the social world. While data is central to the way I work, it is not the focus of my interest in data science. At heart, I am someone that wants to understand how the world works, and enjoys telling stories that help others do the same, and leveraging data and the quantitative techniques that I have learned, allow me to do that.
