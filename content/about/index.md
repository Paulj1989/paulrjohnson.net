I am a data scientist based in London, currently working for the NHS South, Central and West CSU, where I work on a wide range of data science problems, from designing evaluations of healthcare interventions, building and deploying demand forecasting models, and driving the development of data infrastructure and expertise to help expand the organisation's analytical capabilities.

Prior to joining the health sector, I worked in academia as a political scientist. My research focused on party and party system change, particularly the development of new political parties in established systems. 

I have also honed my skills and gained experience in sports analytics, building an expected value model for volleyball, using data from women's college volleyball, and using event data to cluster football players and build a model that identifies players that are most similar to any player in the dataset.

I am interested in applying my knowledge of causal inference, statistics, probabilistic thinking, and machine learning to problems of understanding human behaviour and the social world. While data is central to the way I work, it is not the focus of my interest in data science. At heart, I am someone that wants to understand how the world works, and enjoys telling stories that help others do the same. Leveraging data and my quantitative skillset allows me to do that.
